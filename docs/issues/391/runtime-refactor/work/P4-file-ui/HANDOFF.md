# P4-file-ui — Handoff checklist

Derived strictly from [TODO.md](./TODO.md) and [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md). Tick each before calling this package done. Invent nothing.

## Prerequisites (packages + gates)
- [ ] P3-routes-tools merged — [../P3-routes-tools/HANDOFF.md](../P3-routes-tools/HANDOFF.md)
- [ ] Phase 3 present (write/edit tools + routes in boring-bash) — **STOP and report** if absent

## Beads
- [ ] BBP4-010 — Establish `/plugin` subpath + neutral host adapter
- [ ] BBP4-011 — Move filesystem front plugin files
- [ ] BBP4-012 — Extract a plain internal tree function/type (provider boundary deferred to #295)
- [ ] BBP4-013 — Document-authority write/edit override hook (#367/#226) — DEFERRED (out of this epic)
- [ ] BBP4-014 — Repoint workspace registration + acyclicity guard

## Verification commands
- [ ] `pnpm --filter @hachej/boring-bash run build`
- [ ] `pnpm --filter @hachej/boring-bash run typecheck`
- [ ] `pnpm --filter @hachej/boring-bash run test`
- [ ] `pnpm --filter @hachej/boring-bash run check:invariants`
- [ ] `pnpm --filter @hachej/boring-workspace run typecheck`
- [ ] `pnpm --filter @hachej/boring-workspace run test`
- [ ] `pnpm --filter @hachej/boring-workspace run lint:plugin-invariants`
- [ ] `pnpm lint:invariants`
- [ ] `pnpm audit:imports`
- [ ] `pnpm typecheck`
- [ ] Manual proof (workspace playground): file tree renders; open code/markdown/media/html/pdf panes; `exec_ui openFile` focuses the right panel; agent write updates an open pane via agentFileBridge. Rebuild dist before driving the playground.

## Review gates
- [ ] Phase 3 present (write/edit tools + routes in boring-bash), else STOP+report.
- [ ] Panel ids, `FILESYSTEM_SURFACE_RESOLVER_ID`, and `workspace.open.path` resolve output unchanged.
- [ ] **Zero `boring-bash/plugin → @hachej/boring-workspace` imports of any kind** (no value import AND no `import type`); pure types are local structural declarations; workspace↔boring-bash acyclic; workspace bridge still workspace-owned. The `normalizeUiFilesystem`/`USER_FILESYSTEM_ID`/`uiFileResourceKey` helper **values** are supplied through the `BashPluginHost` adapter. Gate: `grep -rn "@hachej/boring-workspace" packages/boring-bash/src/plugin` returns no matches.
- [ ] Company file-tree root + capability-based readonly panes preserved.
- [ ] Tree data is a single internal function (no provider interface — deferred to #295), current tree shape unchanged; the document-authority write/edit override is **deferred out of this epic** (BBP4-013) — `write`/`edit` stay raw file ops, no hook/interface/null-authority added.
- [ ] `pnpm lint:invariants` + `pnpm audit:imports` + workspace plugin-invariants green.

## Exit criteria
- [ ] `exec_ui openFile` still opens files (same panel ids, same resolver).
- [ ] file tree data flows through one internal function with unchanged behavior (provider boundary deferred to #295).
- [ ] document-authority override deferred out of this epic — `write`/`edit` stay raw file ops; the seam arrives with #367/#226.

## Closeout
- [ ] Zero unowned `TODO(remove:*)` markers for this phase
- [ ] PRs merged per [PR-PLAN.md](../../PR-PLAN.md) (this package's section)
